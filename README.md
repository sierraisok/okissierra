I like to play a lot of spors such as fotball, wrestling, track,  golf, swim and also in my freetime i like to watch youtube.
What i want to learn in computer scienece is to know how to actually do stuff on a computer that is cool.
Learning computer science is important to me because it can help with other stuff and it can be important to know in the future.
